## About the App 
This application is a simple journal recorder, where the user can write their every thoughts.

All entries are placed in chronological order.

## Motivation
Journaling is a healthy way to express one's thoughts and feelings. It is said that journaling is also a healthy coping mechanism when overcoming hard challenges, or struggling with mental health. By journaling one's thoughts along with acknowledging one's emotions, it can feel quite theraputic.
